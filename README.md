# BitTweet - A Nostalgic Twitter

BitTweet is a Django-based web application inspired by the early days of Twitter (circa 2006) and the aesthetic of 1980s/1990s computing. Designed to serve as a personal tweet scrapbook, it allows users to post short messages and view them in a retro-styled timeline. The project highlights Django backend development and pixelated frontend design, offering a unique nostalgic experience.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login to create private tweet timelines.
- **Tweet Management**: Post tweets (up to 140 characters) 
- **Timeline View**: Display user tweets in a pixelated interface.
- **Design**: Utilizes pixel fonts, a blue/white color scheme, and an authentic vintage look.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Django framework with a database.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for pixelated UI implementation.
