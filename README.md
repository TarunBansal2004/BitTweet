# BitTweet - A Nostalgic Twitter

BitTweet is a Django-based web application inspired by the early days of Twitter (circa 2006) and the aesthetic of 1980s/1990s computing. Designed to serve as a personal tweet scrapbook, it allows users to post short messages with mood tags, view them in a retro-styled timeline, and filter them using a memory lane feature. The project highlights Django backend development and pixelated frontend design, offering a unique nostalgic experience.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login to create private tweet timelines.
- **Tweet Management**: Post tweets (up to 140 characters) with mood tags (Happy, Sad, Nostalgic) accompanied by a retro sound effect.
- **Timeline View**: Display user tweets in a CRT-style interface, sorted by date (newest first).
- **Memory Lane**: Filter tweets by mood or date range in a terminal-inspired layout.
- **Retro Bot**: Provides predefined, nostalgic responses (e.g., "Great tweet!") on post submission.
- **Design**: Utilizes pixel fonts, a black/green color scheme, and CRT scanline effects for an authentic vintage look.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Django framework with a database.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for pixelated UI implementation.
- **Resources**: Google Fonts ("Press Start 2P"), Freesound.org (audio effects).
